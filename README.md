# transcription_tracker
A tracker for use with Express Scribe which tracks your stats while working audio transcription

Before working on a file, run reset.py and enter the duration in the format MM:SS (e.g. 45:20) and the file rate in pounds per audio minute (e.g. 0.50).

When you're about to start working on your file, run main.py. It will track stats such as time spent, audio done and remaining, estimated time remaining, WPM, amount earned, and hourly pay rate.
